        <h1>Code Style Guidelines</h1>
        <h3>Arithmetic operaters should be spaced to increase clarity but can be left close together if it makes order of operations clearer</h3>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
// Well spaced for readability
if (i + j == (size - 1)) filter[i][j] = 1;

        <h3>Minimization of depth is preferred, move extensive nesting into helper functions</h3>
        <h3>Avoid reptitive code that could be moved into a function</h3>
        <h3>Code should be documented where necessary but variables names should be chosen to reduce need for documentation</h3>
        <h3>Commented out sections of code should have an explaination for their removal and continued presence</h3>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
/* A possible addition to speed up filter retreival time instead of generating the filter each time */
// class KernelFilterCache
// {
// public:
//     KernelFilterCache();
//     ~KernelFilterCache();

//     int hashFilter(int size, float *args, int arg_len, int kern_type);
//     int saveFilter(KernelFilter kernel);
//     KernelFilter getFilter(int hash);

// private:
//     KernelFilter[] cache;
// };

        <h3>Debugging output should be removed from library functions</h3>
        <h3>Dependencies should be minimized to what is used in the file</h3>
        <pre class="prettyprint">Mask does not depend on any other parts of the library</pre>
        <h3>Classes should have their own file unless they are small enough that adding a new file would decrease readability</h3>
        <pre class="prettyprint">Tool classes are quite small and are left in the same file, but will likely be split off if many more tool types are added</pre>
        <h3>Indentation size should be 4 and use spaces</h3>
        <h3>Class inheritance should be used preferentially especially in cases where a parent class already exists</h3>
        <h3>Constants should be defined prior to use</h3>
        <h3>Static functions should be placed in a properly named namespace</h3>
        <h3>Class names should be descriptive and have capital lettering consistent with the rest of the library</h3>
        <h3>Allocated memory should be deleted. Functions that allocate memory and do not delete it should have a comment alerting the user that they must cleanup the memory</h3>
        <h3>Source files should be placed in the src folder</h3>
        <h3>Header files should be used for all cpp files, but the implementation of functions inline in header files should be avoided</h3>
        <h3>Code documentation is used to generate html docs for the library. Follow Doxygen comment standards for all major classes and functions</h3>
