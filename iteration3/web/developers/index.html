		<h1>Developer Information</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p><b>libphoto</b> is a library designed for creating graphic editing applications.</p>
		<p>Features include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Image file loading and saving</li>
			<li>C++ GLUI interface class for basic gui implementation</li>
			<li>Pixel representation object</li>
			<li>PixelBuffer for holding a canvas of 2D array of pixels</li>
			<li>Image filter handling objects and algorithms</li>
			<li>Painting tool framework</li>
			<li>Undo/redo history data structure</li>
		</ul>

		<p>It depends on libglui for graphical interface and libpng + libjpeg for image loading and saving</p>

		<p>Also included in this release are two example applications FlashPhoto and Mia. These applications setup a GUI (or command line handler for Mia) and create the proper instances of libphoto classes for all functionality</p>

		<h3>FlashPhoto</h3>
		<p>FlashPhoto is a basic photo editing application that supports many drawing tools (e.g. spray can, pen, highlighter) as well as image-wide filters (e.g. sepia tone, blur, sharpen, saturation adjustment). It supports basic features expected from a photo editor such as undo/redo, foreground color adjustment, PNG and JPEG saving/loading, etc.</p>

		<h3>Mia</h3>
        <p>Mia is a basic medical imaging application that supports image loading/saving (JPEG and PNG formats), annotation (using a specialized marker and a red pen), and a small set of filters that are useful for medical images (blur, quantize, etc.). Mia also supports undo/redo functionality; loading, saving, and cycling through a stack of images (useful for CT scans in particular); and a handy command line interface that can be used to apply filters, copy images, and compare images to see if they're identical. </p>
