        <p style="font-size: 125%">The Mia application (menu pictured at right) provides a small set of tools that can be used for viewing, editing, and annotating medical images. At this time, Mia includes support for images in both JPEG and PNG formats. This tutorials focuses on how to load and save images, as well as modify them using the annotation tools provided.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 125%">Loading images in Mia is very straightforward and can be done using the Image I/O menu (see image of image selection menu). To load an image, simply select it in the explorer and click the “Load canvas” button below it. Mia also provides support for loading image stacks, or entire directories full of images. Utilize this functionality, the user can simply load one of the images in the directory, then cycle through the images using the “Previous image” and “Next image” buttons in the Image I/O menu.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 125%">Saving images in Mia is just as easy as loading them. To save an image, select the image file from the explorer or type the new image name in the text box, then click “Save canvas”. The entire canvas will then be saved to the specified file, where it can be viewed by any application or program.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 125%">Mia provides two tools for annotating images: a marker and a pen, both of which are straightforward and easy to use (see image of tool selection menu). The marker tool is simply a red arrow that can be applied to the canvas wherever the user specifies; they only need to select the tool and click on the location which they’d like to mark. Similarly, the pen can be used to draw and write on the image by clicking and dragging the mouse across the canvas with the pen tool selected in the tool selection menu.</p>
